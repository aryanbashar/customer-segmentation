# customer-segmentation
The owner for a franchise mall reaches out to you as a Data Scientist to analyze their data to see how they can improve sales. Through the mall's annual membership cards, you have some general data about their shoppers that include Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. This looks to be a prime example for use of DBSCAN and K-means clustering, which will allow us to cluster groups and see how different factors interact. Spending Score is a rating that is assigned to each customer based on parameters that involve their spending habits. We want understand how customers converge and visualize spending habits. This will be exceedingly important for the marketing team to make data-driven choices and campaigns to target certain groups of shoppers. This notebook will go through the exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure, model building and training, discussion, and conclusion.
